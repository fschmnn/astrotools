# Astrotools

A collection of python tools for astronomy. 

## Description

This package collects general purpose functions that are used in several projects of mine (e.g. [Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function](https://github.com/fschmnn/pnlf) or [Stellar associations powering HII regions](https://github.com/fschmnn/cluster)). Most of them are build on existing `astropy` or `scipy` functions and add certain functionality / shortcuts to make my work easier. 

* **regions**: handle regions in images (either masks or outlines) and re-project them to other images.

* **plot**: help function to create corner plots ...
